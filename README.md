- 👋 Hi, I’m Yordan or Anatomic.
- ⚙️ I do Vulnerability Research and Security stuff in general.
- ⚡️ I am especially interested in low-level stuff, kernels, mainly the Linux Kernel.
- 🌱 Soon might be taking a look at browser vulnerabilities, maybe writing up some old vulns?
- 📫 Feel free to hit me up on Twitter [@YordanStoychev](https://twitter.com/YordanStoychev)
